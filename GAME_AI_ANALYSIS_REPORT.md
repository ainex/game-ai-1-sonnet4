   - No crash reporting
   - No usage analytics
   - No rate limiting

## User Stories Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed User Stories
1. "As a gamer, I want to press a hotkey and ask a question about my game"
2. "As a gamer, I want AI to analyze my screenshot and provide advice"
3. "As a gamer, I want to hear the AI response spoken aloud"
4. "As a gamer, I want to see AI responses in a beautiful overlay"

### ❌ Missing User Stories
1. "As a gamer, I want to review my previous questions and answers"
2. "As a gamer, I want the AI to remember context from previous sessions"
3. "As a gamer, I want to customize hotkeys and AI behavior"
4. "As a gamer, I want to export/share my gaming insights"

## Implementation Gaps Analysis

### Critical Missing Components

1. **Database Layer**
   ```python
   # Expected but missing:
   - models/interaction.py
   - services/database_service.py
   - api/endpoints/history.py
   ```

2. **Memory System**
   ```python
   # Placeholder exists but not implemented:
   - services/memory_manager.py
   - Vector database integration
   - Context retrieval system
   ```

3. **Configuration System**
   ```python
   # Missing:
   - config/settings.py
   - ui/settings_dialog.py
   - User preferences management
   ```

### Architecture Deviations

1. **Client Implementation**
   - Used Python/Tkinter instead of C#/WPF
   - Good decision for cross-platform compatibility
   - Simpler development and deployment

2. **Service Integration**
   - Added Claude 3.5 Sonnet (not in original plan)
   - Smart decision - better multimodal capabilities
   - Proper service abstraction maintained

3. **UI Enhancement**
   - Added sci-fi overlay (not in original plan)
   - Excellent UX improvement
   - Professional appearance

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some endpoints have duplicate code
   - Services could use better abstraction
   - Client main.py is getting large (555 lines)

2. **Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent error messages
   - No unified error handling strategy
   - Silent failures in some cases

3. **Testing**
   - Low test coverage
   - Mocks not properly implemented
   - No automated testing pipeline
